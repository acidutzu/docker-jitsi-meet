## Installation

The installation manual is available [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker).


Quick start

In order to quickly run Jitsi Meet on a machine running Docker and Docker Compose, follow these steps:

    Download and extract the latest release. DO NOT clone the git repository. See below if you are interested in running test images.

    Create a .env file by copying and adjusting env.example:

    cp env.example .env

Set strong passwords in the security section options of .env file by running the following bash script

./gen-passwords.sh

Create required CONFIG directories

    For linux: 

mkdir -p ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/{web,transcripts,prosody/config,prosody/prosody-plugins-custom,jicofo,jvb,jigasi,jibri}

    For Windows: 

echo web,transcripts,prosody/config,prosody/prosody-plugins-custom,jicofo,jvb,jigasi,jibri | % { mkdir "~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/$_" }

Run docker-compose up -d





### Kubernetes

If you plan to install the jitsi-meet stack on a Kubernetes cluster you can find tools and tutorials in the project [Jitsi on Kubernetes](https://github.com/jitsi-contrib/jitsi-kubernetes).

## TODO


* Builtin TURN server.


## DO not forget to put this in the .env
